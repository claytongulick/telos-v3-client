# Telos Reporting Plugin

This plugin is loosely based on mattermost-plugin-starter-template with heavy modifications.

All Typescript, sass, etc.. have been removed.

## Build and Deploy
Build your plugin:
```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.teloshs.reporting.tar.gz
```

## Development

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options. In order for the below options to work, you must first enable plugin uploads via your config.json or API and restart Mattermost.

```json
    "PluginSettings" : {
        ...
        "EnableUploads" : true
    }
```

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```json
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    },
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:
```
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:
```
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a webapp, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

## Q&A

### How do I build the plugin with unminified JavaScript?
Setting the `MM_DEBUG` environment variable will invoke the debug builds. The simplist way to do this is to simply include this variable in your calls to `make` (e.g. `make dist MM_DEBUG=1`).
